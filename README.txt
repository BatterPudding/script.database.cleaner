Kodi's video library records details of everything you watch.  This includes
youtube links, other streams from add-ons, old PVR recordings etc etc

This add-on will remove anything in the file table in the database not
belonging to your sources.xml file.  In other words, anything that you
haven't scanned in on purpose to the library.

NOTE - This add-on could damage your video database.  Whilst every effort
has been taken to ensure this doesn't happen, you run this add-on at
YOUR OWN RISK.  The authors will not be held responsible for anything deleted
from your database/library.
